"""
Problem Statement: Youâ€™re given an unsorted array arr of n integers and an integer x. Find the floor and ceiling of x in arr[0..n-1].
The floor of x is the largest element in the array which is smaller than or equal to x.
The ceiling of x is the smallest element in the array greater than or equal to x.
-------
Example 1:
Input Format: n = 6, arr[] ={3, 4, 4, 7, 8, 10}, x= 5
Result: 4 7
Explanation: The floor of 5 in the array is 4, and the ceiling of 5 in the array is 7.
-------
Example 2:
Input Format: n = 6, arr[] ={3, 4, 4, 7, 8, 10}, x= 8
Result: 8 8
Explanation: The floor of 8 in the array is 8, and the ceiling of 8 in the array is also 8.
