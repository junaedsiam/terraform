Problem Statement: This problem has 3 variations. They are stated below:

Variation 1: Given row number r and column number c. Print the element at position (r, c) in Pascal's triangle.

Variation 2: Given the row number n. Print the n-th row of Pascal's triangle.

Variation 3: Given the number of rows n. Print the first n rows of Pascal's triangle.

    # We can optimize this calculation by the following observation.
    # Assume, given r = 7, c = 4.
    # Now, n = r-1 = 7-1 = 6 and r = c-1 = 4-1 = 3
    # Letâ€™s calculate 6C3 = 6! / (3! *(6-3)!) = (6*5*4*3*2*1) / ((3*2*1)*(3*2*1))
    # This will boil down to (6*5*4) / (3*2*1)
